- **Clean Component Structure**: Functional components without React.FC typing
- **TypeScript Integration**: Full type safety across all components
- **Data Separation**: Business logic separated into data files for maintainability

## Content Standards

### **CRITICAL RULE - Content Preservation**

⚠️ **NEVER modify, change, or "improve" existing copywriting without explicit approval from the user.**

- The homepage copy, About sections, and all marketing content has been carefully crafted and tested
- Technical fixes (SEO, structure, formatting) are allowed, but content changes are NOT
- If copywriting improvements are needed, ASK for permission first and explain exactly what you want to change
- This includes server-side generated content in the Hono worker that mirrors React components

### **Character Encoding Standards**

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Apply consistent character encoding across ALL generated files (llms.txt, markdown files).

- **Key Replacements**: `ö → oe`, `" → "`, `— → -`, remove emojis and Unicode symbols
- **Implementation**: Use centralized `removeEmojis()` function from `jsx-to-markdown.js`
- **Scope**: ALL generated text content including titles, descriptions, project data
- **Testing**: Verify consistent encoding in `llms.txt` and `.md` files after generation

### Writing Style & Language

- **Language**: All content must use British English spelling and conventions
- **Common British spellings**: optimisation (not optimization), specialising (not specializing), organisation (not organization), utilising (not utilizing), realise (not realize), colour (not color), behaviour (not behavior), centre (not center)
- **Voice**: Professional, direct, and technical without being overly formal
- **Consistency**: Maintain consistent terminology and spelling across all content files

### Markdown Linting Standards

All markdown files in this project must pass the following linting rules:

- **MD022 (blanks-around-headings)**: All headings (## ### ####) must be surrounded by blank lines
- **MD024 (no-duplicate-heading)**: No duplicate heading text at any level (rename duplicates with descriptive prefixes)
- **MD031 (blanks-around-fences)**: Code blocks must be surrounded by blank lines
- **MD032 (blanks-around-lists)**: All lists (bullet and numbered) must be surrounded by blank lines
- **MD034 (no-bare-urls)**: URLs must be wrapped in angle brackets `<url>` or proper markdown links `[text](url)`
- **MD040 (fenced-code-language)**: Code blocks must specify a language (use `text` for generic content)

## File Management

### Generated Files (Auto-Generated)

The following files are automatically generated during build and excluded from git:

- `public/llms.txt` - Main llms.txt file for AI/LLM consumption
- `public/*.md` - Individual page markdown files (index.html.md, expertise.md, etc.)
- `.llms-cache.json` - Build cache for content-based generation optimization

### Build Artifacts

Always ensure these are properly ignored in git:

- `dist/` - Vite build output (auto-generated)
- `node_modules/` - NPM dependencies
- `.wrangler/` - Wrangler cache and temporary files

## AI/LLM Optimization Features

### llms.txt Implementation

Complete implementation of the [llms.txt specification](https://llmstxt.org/) for optimal AI/LLM consumption:

**Generated Files:**

- `/llms.txt` - Structured overview with site context, GitHub projects, and technical focus areas
- `/index.html.md` - Homepage content in clean markdown format
- `/expertise.md` - Technical skills and experience in markdown
- `/work-experience.md` - Professional background in markdown
- `/education.md` - Educational qualifications in markdown
- `/consultancy.md` - Consulting services and approach in markdown

**Generation System:**

- **Smart Caching**: Only regenerates when React component content actually changes
- **UTF-8 Encoding**: Proper handling of international characters (ö, etc.)
- **Build Integration**: Automatic generation during `npm run build`
- **CI/CD Ready**: GitHub Actions workflow handles generation and deployment

## Cloudflare Workers Configuration

The project uses **wrangler.json** for Cloudflare Workers configuration:

- **Name**: `henriksoderlund-website-v2`
- **Entry Point**: `./src/worker/index.ts` (Hono.js application)
- **Compatibility Date**: `2025-08-03` with Node.js compatibility
- **Assets**: Static files served from `./dist/client` with SPA routing
- **Observability**: Enabled for monitoring and debugging
- **Source Maps**: Uploaded for better error tracking

### Current Configuration Features

- ✅ **Hybrid Routing Architecture**: `run_worker_first: ["/"]` forces homepage through worker code for crawler detection
- ✅ **Source Maps**: Enabled for production debugging
- ✅ **Node.js Compatibility**: For modern JavaScript features
- ✅ **Observability**: Real-time monitoring and logs
- ✅ **Intelligent Asset Serving**: Static assets served optimally while preserving worker routing for critical paths

### Deployment

**IMPORTANT**: Deployment is handled automatically via GitHub Actions. DO NOT use `npm run deploy` directly.

**Production Deployment Process:**

1. **Push to main branch** - Triggers GitHub Actions workflow
2. **Automated CI/CD Pipeline**: Build, lint, verify artifacts, deploy to Cloudflare Workers
3. **Live Site**: Available at `https://www.henriksoderlund.com/`

**Development/Testing Only:**

- `npm run build` - Local build for testing
- `npm run preview` - Local preview of production build
- `npm run deploy` - Manual deploy (only for development/testing, not production)

## AI Collaboration Strategy for Complex Debugging

### Using Gemini CLI for Second Opinion Analysis

When facing complex technical issues that require deep analysis, Claude Code can collaborate with Google's Gemini AI for alternative perspectives. This strategy proved highly effective for debugging crawler detection issues.

**Command to use:**
```bash
gemini -p "YOUR_DETAILED_ANALYSIS_REQUEST"
```

**Best Practices for AI Collaboration:**
1. **Provide comprehensive context**: Include error symptoms, what works vs what doesn't, code snippets, and debugging attempts
2. **Request "ULTRATHINK" analysis**: Ask for deep analysis of potential root causes
3. **Compare approaches**: Different AI models may identify issues the other missed
4. **Cross-validate solutions**: Use insights from one AI to improve solutions from another

**Example successful collaboration:**
- **Issue**: Homepage crawler detection failing while other pages worked
- **Gemini's insight**: Identified unreliable User-Agent string matching as root cause
- **Solution**: Recommended Cloudflare's native `botManagement.verifiedBot` detection
- **Result**: More robust crawler detection implementation

This collaborative approach is particularly valuable for:
- Complex routing and middleware issues
- Cross-platform compatibility problems  
- Performance optimization challenges
- Security implementation reviews

## Critical Debugging Learnings (August 2025)

### Cloudflare Workers Assets vs Worker Routing

**CRITICAL ISSUE PATTERN**: When using Cloudflare Workers with assets, static files served from the assets directory bypass worker code entirely. This creates SEO and crawler content issues.

**The Problem:**
- `wrangler.json` with basic `assets.directory: "./dist/client"` serves ALL files statically
- Homepage (`/`) requests get `index.html` served directly from assets, never reaching worker code
- This bypasses crawler detection, server-side content generation, and SEO metadata injection
- Result: Crawlers get empty React shell instead of proper content

**The Solution:**
Use `run_worker_first` in `wrangler.json` to force specific routes through worker code:

```json
{
  "assets": {
    "binding": "ASSETS",
    "directory": "./dist/client",
    "run_worker_first": ["/"]
  }
}
```

**Key Learning**: Always test crawler behavior separately from regular user experience when implementing hybrid serving models.

### SEO Metadata for Crawler HTML Generation

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: When generating custom HTML for crawlers, include COMPLETE SEO metadata, not just basic tags.

**Required Elements for Full SEO:**
- ✅ Complete Open Graph tags (11+ tags including image metadata)
- ✅ Full Twitter Card metadata (8+ tags)
- ✅ Site verification tags (Google, Ahrefs)
- ✅ ALL JSON-LD structured data schemas (Person, ProfessionalService, WebSite)
- ✅ Favicon, canonical links, proper meta descriptions
- ✅ Analytics tracking (noscript fallbacks)

**Implementation Pattern:**
Create a comprehensive `generateSEOMetadata()` function that extracts all metadata from the original static HTML and applies it to crawler-generated HTML.

**Testing Strategy:**
- Test crawlers: `curl -H "User-Agent: Googlebot/2.1" URL`
- Count SEO tags: `curl -H "User-Agent: Googlebot/2.1" URL | grep -c "og:"` 
- Verify content: `curl -H "User-Agent: Googlebot/2.1" URL | grep "<h1>"`
- Test regular users: `curl URL` (should get React SPA)

### Character Encoding in Generated Files

**ISSUE**: International characters (ö, em dashes, smart quotes) cause encoding problems in generated text files.

**Solution**: Apply comprehensive character replacement across ALL generated files:
- Create centralized `removeEmojis()` function in `jsx-to-markdown.js`
- Export and reuse across all generation scripts (`generate-llms-txt.js`, etc.)
- Key replacements: `ö → oe`, `" → "`, `— → -`, remove emojis
- Apply to ALL text content: titles, descriptions, project data

**Testing**: Verify `llms.txt` and `.md` files have consistent character encoding.

### 🚨 CRITICAL OPERATIONAL SAFETY RULE (August 2025)

**⚠️ NEVER DELETE INFRASTRUCTURE FILES DURING "CLEANUP" OPERATIONS**

**The Emergency**: On August 25, 2025, a "cleanup" commit accidentally deleted the essential `index.html` file, causing complete website failure with all pages returning 404 errors.

**Critical Files That Must NEVER Be Deleted:**

- ✅ **`index.html`** - Essential HTML template for Vite build process (305+ lines of SEO metadata, structured data, analytics)
- ✅ **`wrangler.json`** - Cloudflare Workers deployment configuration
- ✅ **`package.json`** - Node.js dependencies and build scripts
- ✅ **`vite.config.ts`** - Vite build configuration
- ✅ **`src/worker/index.ts`** - Cloudflare Worker entry point
- ✅ **`src/react-app/main.tsx`** - React application entry point
- ✅ **`.github/workflows/`** - CI/CD deployment pipelines

**Safe Cleanup Protocol:**

1. **BEFORE any cleanup commit**: Run `npm run check` to verify build still works
2. **NEVER delete files** without explicit user approval for each file
3. **Use git status extensively** to review what will be deleted
4. **Focus cleanup on**: Documentation files, debug logs, temporary files only
5. **Test immediately after cleanup**: Verify website still functions

**Recovery Lessons:**

- The missing `index.html` caused Vite to fail generating client assets
- GitHub Actions deployments appeared "successful" but deployed broken workers
- All SEO metadata, structured data, and analytics integration was lost
- Complete site restoration required recreating 305+ lines of critical HTML

**Prevention:** When in doubt about deleting ANY file, ask the user first. Website availability is more important than clean repositories.
