# Homepage Crawler Content Issue - Debugging Session 2025-08-23

## ISSUE
Homepage crawler content injection fails while other pages work perfectly. Crawlers receive empty `<div id="root"></div>` instead of proper H1 and content.

## CONFIRMED WORKING
✅ **Crawler detection and content injection works perfectly for:**
- `/expertise` - Shows full H1 "Expertise" and complete content
- Other routes - All working correctly with crawler content

## CONFIRMED NOT WORKING  
❌ **Homepage paths return empty React shell:**
- `/` - Empty root div for crawlers
- `/index.html` - No response at all

## ROOT CAUSE HYPOTHESIS
**Cloudflare Workers assets serving is intercepting homepage requests before they reach the worker code.**

## EVIDENCE
1. **Routes work for other pages** - proves worker logic is correct
2. **Homepage serves original React SPA** - suggests bypassing worker entirely  
3. **Assets configuration** in `wrangler.json` serves from `./dist/client` which includes `index.html`
4. **Route handlers never called** - even explicit routes before all other middleware don't work

## ATTEMPTED SOLUTIONS (ALL FAILED)
1. **Bulletproof content injection** - Direct HTML generation instead of regex replacement
2. **Route priority debugging** - Moving homepage routes to different positions
3. **Enhanced crawler detection** - Comprehensive logging and pattern matching
4. **Force crawler mode** - Temporary override to test content generation
5. **Explicit homepage routes** - Adding routes before all other middleware

## KEY INSIGHT
The fundamental issue is **routing/asset serving configuration**, not the content injection logic itself.

## NEXT STEPS FOR TOMORROW
1. **Assets configuration approach**: Configure `wrangler.json` to exclude `index.html` from static serving
2. **Alternative worker pattern**: Research Cloudflare Workers + Assets best practices for SPA routing
3. **Minimal reproduction**: Create simple test worker to verify asset serving behavior  
4. **Route precedence debugging**: Investigate Cloudflare Workers route execution order
5. **SPA serving pattern**: Look into proper SPA + SSR hybrid serving patterns

## TECHNICAL NOTES
- Crawler detection function works correctly
- Content generation functions work correctly  
- Custom HTML generation works correctly
- Issue is purely in **request routing/serving layer**

## WORKING CONFIGURATION BASELINE
- All other pages serve crawler content perfectly
- Character encoding fix added to markdown generation script only
- Original site functionality preserved for users
